# EDA-AND-DECISION-TREE-MODEL
📊 EDA and Decision Tree Model
🔎 Project Overview

This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and building a Decision Tree Machine Learning model to analyze patterns and make predictions based on the dataset.

The goal of this project is to:

Understand the structure and patterns in the data

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing

Visualize important insights

Build and evaluate a Decision Tree model

Interpret model performance

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 🐍

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

📌 Steps Performed
1️⃣ Data Understanding

Loaded dataset

2️⃣ Data Cleaning

Handled missing values

Removed duplicates (if any)

Converted categorical variables (if required)

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution plots

Correlation analysis

Feature relationship visualization

Identification of important variables

4️⃣ Model Building – Decision Tree

Train-test split

Model training using DecisionTreeClassifier / DecisionTreeRegressor

Hyperparameter tuning (if applied)

5️⃣ Model Evaluation
